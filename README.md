This is an advanced Version of the W3Schools-Draggable (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp)

To use it, you should have an html-page.

Just put the two lines under this line, at the bottom of your body-tag!

<script src="">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="">


=====LOCAL=STORED=SCRIPTS=====


If you want to have the Scripts locally, just go to both sites and copy all to your files!
